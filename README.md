# Some scripts

There are some scripts here, probably of little use to anyone.

## The Scripts

 * [volume](volume) - requires awesome wm

    ```zsh
    ./volume up   # Turn volume up and notify
    ./volume down # Turn volume down and notify
    ```
 * [make](make) - wrapper for make which notifies upon completion if it took
   more than `n` seconds to complete
